Hey all! This is a project in which I used my college's (VIT) FULLY FLEXIBLE CREDIT SYSTEM(FFCS) to create a database in Sqlite using Python3,
which has information about all the courses and some other information.

The data is taken from a text file which is also attached in this repository.

Remeber to put all the files in a single folder and you can change the file locations wherever necessary.

Make sure to comment out the SQLite INSERT statements after inserting into the DB so that you don't end up creating copies.
