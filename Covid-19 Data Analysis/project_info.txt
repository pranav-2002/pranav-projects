This project basically deals with extracting data from multiple XML files consisting of certain data of COVID-19 during the period 2020-2021
The CASES, DEATHS, INFECTION RATES of INDIA & USA have been compared and graphs have been plotted 
A Databse is created using SQLITE and the whole project is done using Python3 and its various libraries.

The plt.show statements in the Python Code have been commented, one can remove the comment and see one plot at a time(sub plots have not been created)
A code has been written which takes the user input and returns pirticular data.

Remember to keep all the files in a single folder.
