This is my project which includes parsing of an XML file and then adding the data into SQLite Database using Python3

I have created an additional text file for creating a copy of the data in a simple manner and then extracting data from it, 
please don't get confused over this.

Make sure to comment out the SQLite INSERT statements after inserting into the DB so that you don't end up creating copies.
