HEY GUYS!

So this is a small project which deals with extraction of data from an XML file and then using matplotlib to analyse data and create suitable graphs.
It also has a component that deals with creating a databse with the extracted data using the Sqlite library in the Python3

PS: The data in the XML might not be that acurate as it has not been taken from any official website
